# Airbrushing_HIMB Protocol
Airbrush station is located in the hood at the back of the first room of the Gates Lab. Supplies are located in the drawer directly across from the hood on the last work bench (not the sink tabletop next to the hood) in the first room of the Gates Lab. 

**Supplies needed from wetlab:**  
	- Coral fragments: *Either previously snap frozen or will airbursh fresh. If not snap frozen, carry the coral fragment up to the Gates Lab in a small bucket of corresponding experimental treatment seawater (if fragment was in ambient conditions, keep in ambient OR if fragment was in thermal stress, keep in the same thermal stress seawater).*  
	- Filtered Seawater: *0.2 um filtered and no more than 2-3 days old, preferably made day of.*  
	- Whirlpaks (one for each coral fragment that will be airbrushed).  
	- Falcon tubes: *Each coral fragment will require one falcon tube as a final storage tube. The number required will reflect how many coral fragments are airbrushed, and the size required will reflect the final desired volume.*  
	- Sterile syringes (single-use; one per coral fragment)  
	- Sterile filters (single-use; one per coral fragment)

**Decide the following before proceeding:**  
	- Minimum tissue volume desired: *This will affect how much filtered seawater is used and the final storage tube size. This protocol is written for a 50 mL final volume or less. Otherwise adjust the flask size to reflect the final volume. The flask size will limit how much water is used to ensure the final volume does not exceed what is desired.*  
	- Homogenzing step desired: *Gates Lab uses the syringe method or the blender method. The "blender" is located on the bench across from the airbrush hood, the same bench as the supplies drawer.*  

**Acquire the following before proceeding:**  
	- Airbrush (supplies drawer).  
	- 2 Airline hoses and pressure gauge (supplies drawer); the pressure gauge is connected to the black airline hose, which is connected to the multi-color airline hose. The multi-color hose will connect to the airbrush.    
	- Rubber, opaque tubing that will connect the seawater to the airbrush line.    
	- If fragment have been snap frozen, gather an ice bucket and ice to keep the fragment on before airbrushing.  
	- Filtered Seawater from wetlab.  
	- Gloves  
	- 1 50 mL Erlenmeyer Flask (kept on the racks next to the -80C freezers.)  
	- 1 150 mL beaker (kept on the racks next to the -80C freezers.)  

**Cleaning the workspace**:  
1. Wipe down the hood with 70% Bleach, followed by 70% Ethanol. Both chemicals will be in squirt bottles on the bench across from the hood, the bench with the supplies drawer and "blender".  
2. Place new white hood paper down so that all equipment will rest on the paper. 

**Protocol Steps:**  

1. There will be a scuba tank laying horizontally on the ground against the wall next to the hood. Prop upright, and take off the rubber cap from the opening valve.  
2. On the pressure gauge, the rotating piece will cover the open valve on the scuba tank. Twist the pressure gauge to tighten the seal between the two pieces. [**Tank_Setup**](#Tank_Setup)  
3. Connect the airbrush to the multi-color airline hose: twist to connect.  
4. Fill the 50 mL erlenemeyer flask with 70% Ethanol. [**Airbrush_Setup**](#Airbrush_Setup)  
5. Place one end of the clear rubbing tubing into the flask, and twist the end so that the clear tubing will not fall out of the beaker. Place the other end onto the silver male portion of the circular connector that is already connected to the airbrush. If the circular connector is not on the airbrush, it will be in the supplies drawer.
6. Turn on the scuba tank by twisting the black knob away from the user. The pressure gauge will then read how much air is left in the tank. If tank is empty or in the red-marked zone, see below for [**Refilling_Tank**](#Refilling_Tank).  
7. To operate the airbrush, press down and pull back at the same time on the topside trigger. Pressing down will allow air to come from the scuba tank and pulling back will allow filtered seawater to come from the flask. When airbrushing coral, both air and water are necessary in order to avoid damaging the tissue.
8. Grab the two magnetic handles and place on the bottom lip of the hood, these will hold the airbrush while not in use. 
9. Put on gloves, spray 70% Ethanol into palm one of one hand, and wipe gloves with Ethanol to ensure a clean workspace. 
10. Using a kim wipe, gentely wipe down the sides of the airbrush with 70% Ethanol.
11. Gather a 150 mL beaker, and while aiming the airbrush into the beaker, push down and pull back on the airbrush trigger to allow ethanol and air to flow through the airbrush. Keep the airbrush away from the bottom of the beaker to avoid ethanol splashing back at the user or around the hood.
12. Let the ethanol and air continue to flow for 30 seconds to fully clean the inside of the airbrush.
13. Set down the airbrush on the magnetic holder, and empty the 50 mL flask into the 150 mL beaker, the only solution in this beaker should be Ethanol. 
14. Pour the ethanol down the sink and rinse the 150 mL beaker with DI water. Rinse the 50 mL flask with DI water, and fill with 0.2 um filtered seawater. 
15. Repeat steps 11 & 12, but this time with filtered seawater instead of ethanol and let the filtered seawater flow through for about a minute to ensure there is no more ethanol in the airbrush.
16. Open a sterile whirlpak and gently place coral fragment inside the whirlpak. Hold both components with one hand and gently hold the coral fragment with two fingers, covering as little tissue with two fingers as possible. Hold the coral fragment about halfway in the whirlpak so that once airbrushed, the tissue will drip to the bottom of the whirlpak and the coral fragment will not be held in the solution. In order to airbrush the entire coral, user will have to rotate fragment and grip throughout the protocol. 
17. With the other hand, hold and operate the airbrush. Hold the whirlpak and coral fragment so that the opening of the whirlpak faces upwards to avoid losing tissue solution. 
18. Hold the airbrush at least an inch above the coral fragment so that the polyps and sharp structure of the coral does not damage the fragile airbrush pieces. 
19. Push down and pull back on the trigger to operate the airbrush, hovering over a section of tissue for about 10 seconds before releasing moving on to another section. Airbrush the coral fragment in portions to avoid damaging issue. 
20. The tissue will start to lighten and the white, calcium carbonate skeleton of the coral will show. It is very difficult to airbrush every single portion of tissue off of the fragment due to the porous nature of coral structure. Airbrush until the fragment is as pale as possible. 
21. Once finished, remove the coral fragment from the whirlpak and close the whirlpak. Gather scissors and a 50 mL falcon tube. Label the 50 mL falcon tube using a permanent sharpie with the Coral Fragment ID, Date, and Initials. **Double, triple check that the coral fragment ID on the falcon tube is the correct coral fragment that is being airbrushed.**
22. While tilting the whirlpak with solution towards the left, cut the bottom right corner with scissors. Pour the tissue solution into the 50 mL falcon tube (OR syringe directly???). 
23. **HOMOGENZING STEP????**
24. Gather a sterile syringe and sertile filter. Open both packages and clip the filter onto the end of the syringe. 
25. Pour the tissue solution into the syringe. Slowly push down on the syringe to push the solution through the filter into the same, labeled 50 mL falcon tube. 
26. Store the labeled, 50 mL falcon tube in the -80C freezer (right???).

The extra tanks are stored in the dive locker, located by the large shark tanks, across from the dorm/laundry unit. Directly after the entrance to the dive locker, there is a rack for scuba tanks to the left. Place the empty tank in one of the slots and grab a newly filled tank from the same rack. Fully filled tanks will have a black rubber cap over the opening valve. Leave the black cap off the valve of the empty tank. There is a binder with sign-in/out sheets for tank use. Fill out the sheet with the date, user's name, associated lab (Gates), and other required information. Tanks are $6 per tank.
