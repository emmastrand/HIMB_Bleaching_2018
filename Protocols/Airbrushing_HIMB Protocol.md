# Airbrushing_HIMB Protocol
Airbrush station is located in the hood at the back of the first room of the Gates Lab. Supplies are located in the drawer directly across from the hood on the last work bench (not the sink tabletop next to the hood) in the first room of the Gates Lab. 

**Supplies needed from wetlab:**  
	- Coral fragments: *Either previously snap frozen or will airbursh fresh. If not snap frozen, carry the coral fragment up to the Gates Lab in a small bucket of corresponding experimental treatment seawater (if fragment was in ambient conditions, keep in ambient OR if fragment was in thermal stress, keep in the same thermal stress seawater).*  
	- Filtered Seawater: *0.2 um filtered and no more than 2-3 days old, preferably made day of.*

**Decide the following before proceeding:**  
	- Minimum tissue volume desired: *This will affect how much filtered seawater is used and the final storage tube size.*  
	- Homogenzing step desired: *Gates Lab uses the syringe method or the blender method. The "blender" is located on the bench across from the airbrush hood, the same bench as the supplies drawer.*  

**Acquire the following before proceeding:**  
	- Airbrush (supplies drawer).  
	- 2 Airline hoses and pressure gauge (supplies drawer); the pressure gauge is connected to the black airline hose, which is connected to the multi-color airline hose. The multi-color hose will connect to the airbrush.    
	- Rubber, opaque tubing that will connect the seawater to the airbrush line.    
	- If fragment have been snap frozen, gather an ice bucket and ice to keep the fragment on before airbrushing.  
	- Filtered Seawater from wetlab.  
	- Gloves  
	- 1 50 mL beaker (kept on the racks next to the -80C freezers.)


**Protocol Steps:**  
1. There will be a scuba tank laying horizontally on the ground against the wall next to the hood. Prop upright, and take off the rubber cap from the opening valve.  
2.  On the pressure gauge, the rotating piece will cover the open valve on the scuba tank. Twist the pressure gauge to tighten the seal between the two pieces.  
3. Connect the airbrush to the multi-color airline hose: twist to connect.  
4. Turn on the scuba tank by twisting the black knob away from the user. The pressure gauge will then read how much air is left in the tank. If tank is empty or in the red-marked zone, see below for [**Refilling_Tank**](#Refilling_Tank).
