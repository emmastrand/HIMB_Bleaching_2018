# Airbrushing_HIMB Protocol
Airbrush station is located in the hood at the back of the first room of the Gates Lab. Supplies are located in the drawer directly across from the hood on the last work bench (not the sink tabletop next to the hood) in the first room of the Gates Lab. 

**Supplies needed from wetlab:**  
	- Coral fragments: *Either previously snap frozen or will airbursh fresh. If not snap frozen, carry the coral fragment up to the Gates Lab in a small bucket of corresponding experimental treatment seawater (if fragment was in ambient conditions, keep in ambient OR if fragment was in thermal stress, keep in the same thermal stress seawater).*  
	- Filtered Seawater: *0.2 um filtered and no more than 2-3 days old, preferably made day of.*  
	- Whirlpaks (one for each coral fragment that will be airbrushed).  
	- Falcon tubes: *Each coral fragment will require one falcon tube as a final storage tube. The number required will reflect how many coral fragments are airbrushed, and the size required will reflect the final desired volume.*  
	- Sterile syringes (single-use; one per coral fragment)  
	- Sterile filters (single-use; one per coral fragment)

**Decide the following before proceeding:**  
	- Minimum tissue volume desired: *This will affect how much filtered seawater is used and the final storage tube size. This protocol is written for a 50 mL final volume or less. Otherwise adjust the flask size to reflect the final volume. The flask size will limit how much water is used to ensure the final volume does not exceed what is desired.*  
	- Homogenzing step desired: Needs to be a sterile method, so syringe method of pushing homogenate through a sterile needle would be best with this approach 

**Acquire the following before proceeding:**  
	- Airbrush (supplies drawer).  
	- 2 Airline hoses and pressure gauge (supplies drawer); the pressure gauge is connected to the black airline hose, which is connected to the multi-color airline hose. The multi-color hose will connect to the airbrush.    
	- Rubber, opaque tubing that will connect the seawater to the airbrush line.    
	- If fragment have been snap frozen, gather an ice bucket and ice to keep the fragment on before airbrushing.  
	- Filtered Seawater from wetlab.  
	- Gloves  
	- 1 50 mL Erlenmeyer Flask (kept on the racks next to the -80C freezers.)  
	- 1 150 mL beaker (kept on the racks next to the -80C freezers.)  

**Cleaning the workspace**:  
1. Wipe down the hood with 10% Bleach, followed by 70% Ethanol. Make the 10% bleach fresh each day. Make the 70% ethanol fresh with sterile DI water. 
2. Place new white hood paper down so that all equipment will rest on the paper. 


**Protocol Steps:**  

1. There will be a scuba tank laying horizontally on the ground against the wall next to the hood. Prop upright, and take off the rubber cap from the opening valve.  
2. On the pressure gauge, the rotating piece will cover the open valve on the scuba tank. Twist the pressure gauge to tighten the seal between the two pieces. [**Tank_Setup**](#Tank_Setup)  
3. Connect the airbrush to the multi-color airline hose: twist to connect.  
4. Add 10ml of 70% Ethanol to the erlenemeyer flask. [**Airbrush_Setup**](#Airbrush_Setup)  
5. Place one end of the clear rubbing tubing into the flask, and twist the end so that the clear tubing will not fall out of the beaker. Place the other end onto the silver male portion of the circular connector that is already connected to the airbrush. If the circular connector is not on the airbrush, it will be in the supplies drawer.
6. Turn on the scuba tank by twisting the black knob away from the user. The pressure gauge will then read how much air is left in the tank. If tank is empty or in the red-marked zone, see below for [**Refilling_Tank**](#Refilling_Tank).  
7. To operate the airbrush, press down and pull back at the same time on the topside trigger. Pressing down will allow air to come from the scuba tank and pulling back will allow filtered seawater to come from the flask. When airbrushing coral, both air and water are necessary in order to avoid damaging the tissue.
8. Grab the two magnetic handles and place on the bottom lip of the hood, these will hold the airbrush while not in use. 
9. Put on gloves, spray 70% Ethanol into palm one of one hand, and wipe gloves with Ethanol to ensure a clean workspace. 
10. Using a kim wipe, gentely wipe down the sides of the airbrush with 70% Ethanol.
11. Gather a 150 mL beaker, and while aiming the airbrush into the beaker, push down and pull back on the airbrush trigger to allow ethanol and air to flow through the airbrush. Keep the airbrush away from the bottom of the beaker to avoid ethanol splashing back at the user or around the hood.
12. Let the ethanol and air continue to flow for 30 seconds to fully clean the inside of the airbrush.
13. Set down the airbrush on the magnetic holder, and empty the 50 mL flask into the 150 mL beaker, the only solution in this beaker should be Ethanol. 
14. Rinse the 150 mL beaker with sterile DI water. Rinse the 50 mL flask with sterile DI water, and fill with 0.2 um filtered seawater. 
15. Open a sterile whirlpak and gently place coral fragment inside the whirlpak. Hold the airrush with one hand and gently hold the coral fragment upside down inside the whirlpak, with the plug out the top, using the sides of the whirlpak to hold the coral . Hold the coral fragment  in the whirlpak so that once airbrushed, the tissue will drip to the bottom of the whirlpak and the coral fragment will not be held in the solution. In order to airbrush the entire coral, user will have to rotate fragment throughout the protocol.  Hold the whirlpak and coral fragment so that the opening of the whirlpak faces upwards to avoid losing tissue solution. 
16. Hold the airbrush at least an inch above the coral fragment so that the polyps and sharp structure of the coral does not damage the fragile airbrush pieces. 
17. Push down and pull back on the trigger to operate the airbrush, hovering over a section of tissue to clear the skeleton before releasing moving on to another section.  White, calcium carbonate skeleton of the coral will show. It can be difficult to airbrush every single portion of tissue off of the fragment due to the porous nature of coral structure. Airbrush until the fragment is as white as possible. 
18. Once finished, remove the coral fragment from the whirlpak and close the whirlpak. Gather scissors and a 50 mL falcon tube. Label the 50 mL falcon tube using a permanent sharpie with the Coral Fragment ID, Date, and Initials. **Double check that the coral fragment ID on the falcon tube is the correct coral fragment that is being airbrushed.**
19. While tilting the whirlpak with solution towards the left, cut the bottom right corner with scissors. Pour the tissue solution into the 50 mL falcon tube (OR syringe directly???). 
20. Gather a sterile syringe and sertile needle. Open both packages and clip the needle onto the end of the syringe. 
21. Homogenize the coral tissue by pulling it back and forth through a sterile needle connected to a sterile syringe. Then load the syringe fully. Remove the needed and attach a sterile 0.45µm filter. 
22. Slowly push down on the syringe to push the solution through the filter into a new labeled 50 mL falcon tube. This is done to concentrate the bacterial fraction.  Add this fraction to 6 labeled 2 ml tubes and spin them down using the vacufuge. 
23. Store the concentrated fraction at -80°C.

The extra tanks are stored in the dive locker, located by the large shark tanks, across from the dorm/laundry unit. Directly after the entrance to the dive locker, there is a rack for scuba tanks to the left. Place the empty tank in one of the slots and grab a newly filled tank from the same rack. Full tanks will have a black rubber cap over the opening valve. Leave the black cap off the valve of the empty tank. There is a binder with sign-in/out sheets for tank use. Fill out the sheet with the date, user's name, associated lab (Gates), and other required information. Tanks are $6 per tank.
