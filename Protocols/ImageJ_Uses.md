#### Measuring Bleaching  
This protcol is mainly used for time series comparisons during bleaching experiments. The goal is to compare the final day's bleaching to the coral fragment's original color from day one. 

1. Color Standard Ruler: *A tri-color standard will be used to evaluate the color of coral fragments in the application ImageJ. A photo will be taken with the constructed ruler next to each coral fragment.*  
	2. Acquire: a small, transparent plastic ruler / green, blue, and red electrical tape 
	3. Near one end of the ruler, wrap a small piece of red electrical tape around the ruler so that the tape edges are perpendicular to the length (long) sides of the ruler. Repeat with green and blue, each new piece of tape directly below the last. 
	4. Make sure the overlapping edges of the tape ends are all on one side, this will be hidden while in use. The goal is to have clear, solid red green and blue squares displayed in the photos taken.
